# Genetic Algorithm
Genetic algorithms have become increasingly important for researchers in resolving difficult problems because they can 
	provide feasible solutions in limited time. Using genetic algorithms to solve a problem involves first defining a 
	representation that describes the problem states.
	A novel genetic algorithm based on encoding. Appropriate  crossover and mutation operations are designed to generate the 
	next generations. The proposed crossover operator may adopt combination to generate the offspring chromosomes. A repairing 
	mechanism is also adopted to adjust infeasible chromosomes into feasible ones. Several  mutation operators, including 
	two-pointswapping, string swapping, and substring swapping, are presented.
